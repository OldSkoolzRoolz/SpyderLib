    I welcome any and all contributors no matter how big or small the contribution. In my 40+ years in big tech, I

always felt intimdated or apprehensive approaching new jobs or the first couple weeks on the job. We all have at some
point
or another. Hopefully collaborating on projects in this form can help new comers gain the confidence to shine and learn
techniques
and to excel in their careers.

    If at any point anyone does not feel comfortable in this community, PLEASE let me know immediately



      The quickest way to find yourself wandering the hallways alone is to demean another user or to belittle their

skill level or their work and achievements, here or on ANY OTHER COMMUNITY on Github.
It will not be tolerated!  I am olDSkoolz and I believe that there are no stupid questions.
Questions and our thirst for knowledge and growth is what makes us a sentient being. I will not tolerate
this behaviour in any degree and will expell anyone making disparoging remarks of another member.

        That drive to learn is the most important quality of our imagination

and the ability to "think outside of the box". To draw on more recent analogies, it is the very thing that humans
have been striving to achieve with AI and until recently have fallen short.

       There is a popular coding message board that seems to thrive on demeaning others if they don't ask a question 

just right or may not be using the correct terminology, I find this appauling. I will post this everywhere as a
reminder.

I want everyone to feel welcome newby or old school punch card pro.
