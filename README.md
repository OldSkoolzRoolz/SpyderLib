Spyder Library

The Spyder Library is a portable lightweight network crawler and parser. Spyder can search the page for specific html
tags and records the URL to process later. Can be implemented as a service and use the built in console menu or drop it
in an app of your choice. Very flexible and can respect the robots rule file and employs a throttling mechanism to
ensure polite crawling protocols. Methods are optimized for multi-threaded speed and safety.

### Logging
